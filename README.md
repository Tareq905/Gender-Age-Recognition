# Gender and Age Recognition with Neural Networks   

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project implements a deep learning model to accurately detect and classify **gender** and **age** from images. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs), the system analyzes facial features to provide real-time recognition, making it suitable for various applications, including personalized services, demographic analysis, and human-computer interaction.

## ⚙️ Installation  
Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gender-age-recognition.git  
cd gender-age-recognition  
```

## 📊 Dataset
- This project uses publicly available datasets like UTKFace, Adience, or any custom-labeled datasets. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed before training.

## 🧠 Model Architecture
- The model is designed using a multi-output CNN, where one branch predicts gender (binary classification), and the other predicts age (regression).

##🔍 How It Works
- Preprocessing: Resizing images and normalizing pixel values.
- Training: Optimized loss functions for gender classification and age regression.
- Prediction: Provides outputs with confidence scores.
