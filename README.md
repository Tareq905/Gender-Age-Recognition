## ⚙️ Installation  
Clone this repository:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gender-age-recognition.git  
   cd gender-age-recognition  ```

🧠 Model Architecture
The model is designed using a multi-output CNN, where one branch predicts gender (binary classification), and the other predicts age (regression).
